Problem Statement:  As a user, I need to track my personal fitness scores and the history of PT test scores while not being logged into the Air Force portal. If I am either new to working out and physical fitness or experienced, I need an application to guide me with workout routines that can increase my scores, depending on what my current scores are. For example, if one user is scoring in the 70s and another in the 90s, they should be given different supplemental workouts depending on intensity to help them meet their goals. Additionally, a user should be able to hit a random workout on the main page that references their scores to give them an appropriate random workout.
